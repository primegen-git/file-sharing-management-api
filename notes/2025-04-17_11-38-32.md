# Creating the user table

# password hashing
  1. go to python documentation on pip install passlib and **"RTFM"** [webiste](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

### register user functionality is done, we can check it at commit "create user register"


# creating login method
  - ### Logic for login
       - create a endpoint for the login:
         - user provide the username and password
       - create an endpoint ("/token) : -> validate the username and passowrd and the generate the jwt and set that in the cookie
         - you can get the token with this endpoint
         - you can use this endpoint method in the login


# NOTE:

    . Return: For success (2xx) and sometimes for predictable, client-caused errors (4xx) where you want full control over the response structure.

    . Raise HTTPException (or similar): For common, standard HTTP error conditions (4xx) as a convenient shortcut handled by the framework.

    . Raise other/generic Exception: For unexpected server-side failures (leading to 5xx), letting a higher-level handler log the details and return a generic error to the client.


# NOTE FOR HOW TO PERFORM THE TO LOGIN AND CREATE THE JWT TOKEN
### for more information read page. [website](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/oauth2-jwt/#hash-and-verify-the-passwords)
1. get the user from the database
2. if the user does not exist -> raise HTTPException
3. if the user do exist.
   ### create the jwt token
      - create the payload for the jwt token.
      - then simply encode the payload
4. return the access token with the token type
